#Algorithm of Structured Grid Generation 

1. Input airfoil database
2. Compute airfoil parameters
3. Check grid type (O grid, H grid, or C grid)
4. Compute grid outer boundary points and inner-outer-bridge
5. Compute the grid between the inner and outer boundaries
6. Print the output with csv format
7. Open the output with Paraview software, visualize the grid.
